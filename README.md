# msi2lmp_c
## This repo stores a modified version of msi2lmp tool from LAMMPS repo and is only for personal research purpose.
### The new functions are:
### (1) Let all particles be in the PBC box as much as possible (tiny difference against MS);
### (2) Add an option to re-origin the system when the simulation box is orthogonal;
### (3) Add simple CmakeLists.txt and launch.json to debug within Clion and VS Code conveniently other than compile & run using CMD.
